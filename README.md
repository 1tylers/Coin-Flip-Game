# Coin-Flip-Game

A game that flips 4 coins each time, penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.
Each coin is tested if they land heads or tails, if the coin land heads, it adds its value to the total, starting at 0.
After each turn if the total eventually adds up to $1 exactly, then you win, but if you go over $1 you lose.
